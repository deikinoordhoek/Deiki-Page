                            In Ubuntu 8.04, you had to install software through a program called "Add\Remove Programs". But it was seriously overcomplicated - and, we're ashamed to admit, poorly designed.

                            <p>So now we've created a new way to install software - the Software Center. It's dead simple - just two clicks can install any piece of software.  Have a look at the new features.
